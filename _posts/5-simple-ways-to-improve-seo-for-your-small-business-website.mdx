Imagine shouting, "Look at me," in a large crowd - you might get some attention, but they'll return to their activities eventually. When you have the correct tools to reach an audience, for example, a megaphone, you are going to see better results. The internet works the same way; when you utilize SEO as a tool, your content will be seen by more people. The more work you put in, the more traffic you get out of it.

SEO, or search engine optimization, is the process of improving the visibility and ranking of your small business website on search engines. When potential customers are searching for products or services that your small business offers, you want your website to show up as one of the top results.

Here are a few simple ways you can improve your SEO:

1. Use semantic headings on your page. This will help Google and other search engines understand the hierarchy of your content and assign it the correct ranking.
2. Make sure all of your pictures are available to everyone, not just a specific subgroup (sighted users). Inclusion will improve your search position. You can do this by adding descriptive text to your photos with an alt tag.
3. Use links that are descriptive of the content youâ€™re linking to. Learn More and Click Here are not super helpful and for those who use different technology to navigate your site, you want to be clear on why they should take this action. Try explaining why they should click the button in the link text. This will help improve your click-through rate and keep visitors on your page longer.
4. Reference your own internal posts frequently. Not only does this help keep people on your page longer, but it also tells Google and other search engines that your website is a valuable resource.
5. Monitor your SEO progress and make changes as needed. The best way to improve your ranking is to constantly evaluate your website and make small adjustments.

Let's assume you tried all of the above methods. How do you know if your efforts are working? That's where analytics tools like Google Analytics and Google Search Console come in. You may use these tools to evaluate the organic search traffic on your website, which can tell you whether or not your SEO efforts are successful.

SEO is an ever-evolving field, and the best way to stay ahead of the curve is to constantly educate yourself. If you're looking for more small business SEO tips, be sure to check out our blog. We have a ton of helpful articles that will get you started on the right track. Thanks for reading!
